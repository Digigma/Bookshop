# Bookshop
The application created is to access the library (database) of a bookshop, and to modify that. Modifications can be in the form of quantity, price or just add a new book or remove it all together.
My application has 3 classes. The Book class, BookshopMain class and the LaunchBookshop class.
The Book class would describe of how a book would be represented in the database. It contains an ISBN, title, author, price, and the quantity in stock. This class is used to create and update books.
The BookshopMain class would contain the queries needed to update a book from the library (database) or add/remove books from it. This class would call in the Book class when needed to update it, create it, or just view it. This class also contains the GUI.
The LaunchBookshop class is containing the main method that is used to launch the application.
